Name of Project: IBotanist

Project Overview:
    This project will aim to create a system that will be able to remotely monitor the welfare of a plant and provide a user with tips and reminder about their plant. For example, they may receive a notification to their phone reminding them to water their plant each day, as well as updates on the plant's health from real-time data. This system will incorporate multiple sensors. Below are the sensors we will be using and a short sentence about what they will be used for.

Hardware
    Temperature sensor - collects surrounding air temperature in celsius
    Light sensor - collects light intensity in lumens
    Humidity sensor - collects water levels in the air in relative humidity
    LCD display - displays collected information
    Buzzer - alerts user that something needs addressing (i.e., light intensity too high)
    Button - multifunction button to:
        Turn off buzzer
        Rotate through collected information
        Perform a check (manually) of the levels

=> GitHub - stores code for our project that can be edited at any time.
=> ThinkBoard - stores data if the data goes above a max. threshold, or a min. threshold, and alerts the user with the time and date the alert was set off.
