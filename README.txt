Summary
    Create an IOT device that can measure and relay information about a plant/environment to a user
    It should be able to handle any plant by asking the user to input the name of the plant and then finding the relevant statistics to maintain the plant at; water levels, surrounding temperature, sunlight exposure...
    The measured data must be relayed to the user via an app that they can log into


Hardware
    Temperature sensor - collects surrounding air temperature in celsius
    Light sensor - collects light intensity in lumens
    Humidity sensor - collects water levels in the air in relative humidity
    LCD display - displays collected information
    Buzzer - alerts user that something needs addressing (i.e., light intensity too high)
    Button - multifunction button to:
        Turn off buzzer
        Rotate through collected information
        Perform a check (manually) of the levels

Software/programs
