## 1. Explain the problem you tackled and its importance/significance
The problem that we wanted to solve was the lack of budget-friendly pant sensors that were compatible with both small-scale (house plants) and large-scale (greenhouse) gardens. Its significance in the current market is that sensors for small-scale areas are relatively cheap and compact, but sensors for large-scale areas can be bulky and expensive, or multiple small devices are requried which have no way of interacting with one another.


## 2. Explain the solution you proposed and what you built
The solution that we proposed was a compact device that could be put anywhere and monitor the surroundings. The solution we built was a modular device that, while not as contained as we would've liked,  allows for the sensors to be positioned according to what the user needs.

## 3. Describe who are potential benefactors
The main potential benefactors are those who have plants growing in a larger area than a plant pot (such as a greenhouse), where the monitoring of the area is more beneficial due to the various number of plants they have growing.


## 4. Explain overall architecture



## 5. Demonstrate all the functionalities



## > Explain all the functionalities you initially planned to develop but failed to do so
We planned on having a Raspberry Pi to act as a local server so we wouldn't have to send the data to an external location (like ThinkBoard, which we are using), we failed to implement this as we did not have access to a Raspberry Pi outside of the scheduled lab sessions.


## > Explain the reasons for the failure to implement each feature



## 6. Explain the main challenges you faced
The Arduino stopped being correctly identified by any device we attempted to connect it to. This in turn brought our development of all listed functionalities to a halt as we could no longer program in our extended functionalities, and we could no longer ensure that any modifications to the program would work as intended.


## 7. Describe the lessons you learnt and things you would do differently if you were to do it again
We learnt that having a backup method available is crucial as problems can occur at any time, and not having something to fall back on is a mistake on our part. When doing this project again, we would find a way to obtain a backup option early on so in a worst-case scenario, we would have something to fall back on.


## 8. Explain how you could (would) develop this project further
